# load-lock-life
My continuation for the Ludum Dare 44 Game Jam

###### Developed by Kjip.

## Short Description
Load - Lock - Life is a third-person shooter game in which you play as a cube. You need to defeat as many enemies as possible without dying. But be careful, shooting drains your health!

## Why I made the game
This game was originally a submission for the Ludum Dare 44 Game Jam. I decided to continue it since I quite liked the idea and wanted to add more features to it.

## What I learned from this project (so far)
With every project I do, I hope to learn something from it. (For a post-mortem on the game jam project, check [here](https://github.com/KjipGamer/ludum-dare-44))
Further completing this project I learned:
- To rewrite poorly written code
- Have an organised hierarchy structure 
- Create a central "game manager" for easier use and cleaner code
- Write cleaner code

Overall, this project was very helpful towards developing my skillset and expanding my portfolio for future use.

## What I would change
> If I were to start the project all over again, what would I do differently, what would I change?
